          It is MDH Construction's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
          information We may collect while operating Our website. This Privacy
          Policy applies to <Link to="/">https://www.mdhconstruction.com</Link>{' '}
          (hereinafter, "We", "Us", "Our" or "
          <Link to="/">https://www.mdhconstruction.com</Link>"). We respect your
          privacy and We're committed to protecting personally identifiable
          information you may provide Us through the Website. We have adopted
          this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may
          be collected on Our Website, how We use this information, and under
          what circumstances We may disclose the information to third parties.
          This Privacy Policy applies only to information We collect through the
          Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other
          sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy sets forth the general rules and policies
          governing your use of Our Website. Depending on your activities when
          visiting my Website, you may be required to agree to additional Terms

        <h3 className="text-left pt-5 pb-4">Website Visitors</h3>
        <p>
          Like most website operators, MDH Construction collects
          non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
          and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
          language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
          visitor request. MDH Construction's purpose in collecting
          non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MDH
          Construction's visitors use Our website. From time to time, MDH
          Construction may release non-personally-identifying information in the
          aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          MDH Construction also collects potentially personally-identifying
          information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
          and for users leaving comments on{' '}
          <Link to="/">https://www.mdhconstruction.com</Link> blog posts. MDH
          Construction only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses
          under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
          personally-identifying information as described below.

          Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
        </h3>
        <p>
          Certain visitors to MDH Construction's website choose to interact with
          MDH Construction in ways that require MDH Construction to gather
          personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
          that MDH Construction gathers depends on the nature of the
          interaction. For example, We ask visitors who sign up for a blog at{' '}
          <Link to="/">https://www.mdhconstruction.com</Link> to provide a
          username and email address.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-left pt-5 pb-4">Security</h3>
        <p>
          The security of your Personal Information is important to Us, but

          of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use
          commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, We
          cannot guarantee its absolute security.

          page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors,
          including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past
          visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with
          Our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the
          Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of
          interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently
          using a browser plugin.
